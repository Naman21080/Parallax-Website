            Nature is the connection between the physical world surrounding us and the life inside us. Nature is God’s most precious and valuable gift to humans. It is the principal source of all essential nutrients for all living things on the planet.For all of us, nature is crucial. It’s the reason for the existence of life on this planet. Nature is home to many different creatures. All living organisms benefit from the natural balance maintained by Mother Nature. The study of the natural environment is a separate discipline of science. Every element has its own story to tell. Nature’s beauty is portrayed through the sun and moon, the plants, the flowers, etc. It is a common belief that reacting to something is a natural human characteristic.

For survival, every creature is interrelated and reliant on one another. Humans, for example, rely on nature for their survival, and nature provides us with oxygen, food, water, shelter, medicines, and clothing, among other things.

            Naturally drawn characteristics are defined as genetic traits of an organism in sociology. The resources of nature are plentiful as <b><i>Whispers of the Earth</i></b>. Nature has provided us with a variety of ways to utilise it effectively.With the increasing population, the threats towards nature are increasing. With the growth in population, the resources are now depleting. Excessive levels of air and environmental pollutants add to the mix.The extinction of species as enormous as dinosaurs and the survival of animals as tiny as ants have been documented in history. It is unavoidable to remember, among other things, that nature can play both a protective and destructive role.

            Nature is a source of life. Our planet is a sacred source of life; a living organism that is the common home for us and all the other living species. Economy is a subset of ecology.Humans are as much nature as trees and animals. Humans and nature are not separate. Humans and nature are one. We are all one. This unity of life, this interconnectedness, interdependence, interrelationship needs to be recognised and acknowledged.
